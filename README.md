## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eun-Rae, living in Germany and learning web development in a six-month boot camp. 
I'm passionate about creating innovative & creative web solutions and constantly improving my skills.

**E-LeeSchaffer/E-LeeSchaffer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development at Neue Fische Bootcamp
